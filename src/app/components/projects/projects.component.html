        <h2>Front End Development/Consultant</h2>
        <p>Redlure is an open-source phishing platform designed to be a feature-rich solution for
            red teamers and penetration testers. The application uses a distributed model that grants one interface
            access to multiple campaigns running on different servers and domains simultaneously. It provides a
            robust
            campaign creation platform with custom email templates, linked landing pages and payload integration to
            emulate real-world scenarios.
