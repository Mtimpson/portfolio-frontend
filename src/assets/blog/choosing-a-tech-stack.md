Title: Choosing a Tech Stack

**Build Something!**

When I decided to launch my own portfolio site I admitlity over analyzed the process of picking a tech stack.  There are many decisions you need to make along the way such as do you want to use a framework? Static Site Generator? Where should I host? Should I start from scratch? 

The biggest advice I could give to someone wanting to build a portfolio site is to start by picking something!  There are endless amounts of options to choose from and you could spend an entire year researching each possible solution.  In the end I selected a frontend framework I was comfortable in, a backend language that I always wanted to learn and a hosting platform that was streamlined yet still gave me the control I was looking for. 

**Technology Stack**:
I’m going to list my tech stack and then go into my thought process for picking each tool below:
- Frontend Framework:  ([Angular](https://angular.io))
- Frontend Language:  ([Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))
- Backend: [Node.js ]((https://nodejs.org/en/))
- Query Language:  ([GraphQL](https://graphql.org))
- Hosting Platform:  ([Heroku](https://www.heroku.com))
- Content Management System:  ([Strapi](https://strapi.io))
- Media Library:  ([Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com))
- Domain Registration:  ([Google Domains](https://domains.google.com))
- Analytics:  ([Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com))

**But Why**,

[Angular](https://angular.io): is a platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.  As a full stack software engineer I often get asked what my strongest area of development is.  Right now I would answer, frontend development using Angular.  I’ve led several successful angular projects in my professional career thus far and now have a lot of experience building modern web applications using Angular.  I wanted to use Angular for this project to have a playground outside of my 9 to 5 job that I can experiment with.  Since I had lots of experience setting up Angular projects I was able to get my frontend up and running in fairly short order.  

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): is a strongly typed programming language which builds on JavaScript.  Typescript and Angular go hand in hand as Typescript is the primary language for Angular application development.  If you like JavaScript and haven’t tried Typescript I would strongly consider giving it a try.

[Node.js ](https://nodejs.org/en/): is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.  Before launching my portfolio site I had only heard things about nodejs.  The idea of having typescript on the front end and the backend intrigued me since I had become so accustomed to using typescript with Angular.  Node.js seemed like a lightweight backend solution and I couldn’t be happier with my decision.  A portfolio project is the perfect place for learning and I’ve been happy with what I’ve been able to build using node.js.  

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org): is a query language for your API.  This was another decision I made out of curiosity.  I’ve become well planted in REST API’s in my professional career but wanted to see what all the noise was about regarding GraphQl.  I haven’t been disappointed with my decision.  I was able to write simple queries to get the information about the articles or the specific blog post.  Choosing tools I haven’t used before is the quickest way for me to learn new things.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com): is a platform as a service (Paas) that enables developers to build, run, & operate applications entirely in the cloud.  This is my first project using Heroku and after using it I can definitely understand the appeal.  It was extremely easy to set up and the Heroku CLI made management simple.  I was able to break my project out and have two dynos - one running the frontend and one running the backend.  For a small project it was nice to be able to focus on developing my application and have Heroku automatically configure the required infrastructure.  One downside I’ve run into is that if you want your app to always be running, it’ll cost you $7 a month per dyno. 

[Strapi](https://strapi.io): is an open-source headless CMS.  Because the main focus of my application was going to be a blog I wanted a lightweight content management system that was easy to set up and relatively low cost.  Strapi was that solution for me.  It allows me to quickly make changes to the content on my website without writing a line of code.  I found strapi’s documentation to be very easy to understand and it allowed me to quickly launch my blog with articles, categories, and more.   I was able to follow along an excellent setup guide written by Maxime Castres that gave me a lot of confidence in setting up my own project.  I’ve gone ahead and linked that here: https://strapi.io/blog/strapi-starter-angular-blog

[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com): provides cloud based image and video management server.  Setting up my cloudinary account was quick and free.  I use cloudinary to store my photo uploads for my blog posts.

[Google Domains](https://domains.google.com): when it comes to finding a domain for your website there are lots of different options.  What I like about google domains is the pricing is not outrageous (domain’s start at $7 per year) and it’s one less account you need to create.  If you're like me then you already have a google account so when I found out about google offered domains it was one less account to keep track of.  Searching for my domain was simple as well as registering. 

[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com): more of the same here in regards to google analytics.  Having the domain registered with google and already having a google account it made sense to me to use google analytics.  It was easy to integrate the basic functionality into my site and I’m excited to explore further into what google analytics has to offer.

**That’s it!** 

These are all of the tools and services that I used to create, host, and deploy my personal portfolio site.  As a full time software engineer you often inherit tech stacks, have business requirements that push you in different directions, as well as outside factors that limit what tools you can use.  I would encourage anyone who wanted to build their own website to get out of their comfort zone and try out new technologies.  One of the most fun parts of building my site was seeing what new tools are out there, deciding what technologies I wanted to try out and then figuring out how to put all the pieces together.  Regardless of what tech stack you decide to choose, the important thing is that you’re enjoying the journey and always trying to learn new things.
