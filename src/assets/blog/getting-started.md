Title: Getting Started

Hello, 

Over the past few weeks I've been enjoying putting together a portfolio site for myself.  This is a project that I have wanted to complete for a few years now (and have prototyped 3+ different times), however, as we all know sometimes life gets in the way.  Recently, I have found myself with a little more free time and I have been able to finally put together a site that I am proud of.  

In the next few blog posts I plan on talking about the tech stack that I used to create this project and what my plans are for the future.  With this post though, I will leave you with a photo of some of the initial development work on my portfolio.  I took this just after changing the header from blue to white and I thought it really made the site pop.

Looking forward to more posts in 2021.
-Michael
