Title: How to Auto Dial Conference Call Codes

After ***two years*** of remote work and joining countless phone conference meetings, I finally figured out how to auto dial into a meeting!

Gone are the days of remembering (or forgetting) ambiguous conference line codes and different numbers for different meetings.  Luckily, there is a way to auto dial your conference number codes that many people have already heard of.  If you have not done this before and have to dial into meetings, you are in the right place! 

Go to your phone’s contact app (this will work on Android or iOS) and create a new contact. Ex: Daily Standup Meeting.
- In the phone number section, enter the conference code followed by two commas, it should look like this: ‘,,’.
- After the commas, enter your conference/meeting code.  If your meeting code requires a # at the end simply add it at the end of the code.
- That’s It! If you need an example just look at the picture above.  Your phone will now auto dial you into your conference. 

I hope this helps you as much as it helped me, I’m only a little ***embarrassed*** that it took me two years to figure it out…
