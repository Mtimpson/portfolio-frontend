Title: Today Was a Good Day!

Happy Friday everyone, today was a good day!

Recently, the team I work on had an opening for a Junior Developer position. We were struggling to find candidates so I decided to reach out to one of my University of Mary Washington computer science professors (from 5 years ago) who was able to quickly send me an extremely qualified candidate. We setup an interview and determined she would be a great fit to join the team. Fast forward to today, I find out that the candidate has accepted [Masslight's](https://www.masslight.com/) offer and will be joining the company and my project. This was the third hire I had facilitated in the past two years on this project which has had continued growth & success.

Four (long & short) years ago I was on the other side of the table, looking to get my foot in the door as a soon to be college graduate not knowing where my career might take me. I’ve been blessed up to this point in my career to have worked for an amazing company while having great mentors that have pushed and guided me to be in the position I am today. This moment today was an important reflection point for me to look back on my career thus far and be thankful for the opportunities I’ve been given while staying motivated for the continued growth ahead.

With all that being said, we are still looking for one Mid Level - Senior full stack developer to join our our team. If you or someone you know thinks they would be a good fit please don’t hesitate to reach out!
