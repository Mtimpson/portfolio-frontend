Title: Why Northern Virginia is a Strong Market for Angular Developers

While [React](https://reactjs.org/) continues to dominate the front end development frameworks in popularity [Angular](https://angular.io/) makes a strong case for career growth in the Northern Virginia/Washington DC metro area.  Read any online blog site, browse reddit, or chat with other developers and you will certainly hear about React.  
The most popular framework since 2019 shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon and is great choice for launching your development career.  That being said I have begun to notice a trend - specific to the Northern Virginia marketplace.  There is an extremely high demand for good Angular developers.

If you are a developer right now you’re likely in high demand as it is but a good Angular developer will have no problem landing a high paying job in Northern Virginia.  If you take a look around, you will realize that some of the biggest and most competitive employers in our area are all using Angular.  [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/), [Freddie Mac](https://www.freddiemac.com/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/), and the U.S. government to name a few are all leveraging Angular on a daily basis.  If you do a quick job search you will quickly find lots of unfilled Angular developer roles across the Northern Virginia area waiting to be filled.  With React garnering so much attention there may also be less competition for some of these roles.

If you are an Angular developer looking to relocate to a hot tech market, I would highly recommend interviewing in the Northern Virginia job market.  Due to the areas biggest employers all using Angular and a growing tech scene it is an extremely competitive marketplace where you will have ample opportunity for continued growth both professionally and personally.
